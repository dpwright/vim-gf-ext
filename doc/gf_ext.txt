INTRODUCTION                                    *gf-ext*

gf-ext is a simple extension to the `gf` command in vim, to allow it to open
the file in an arbitrary program rather than as a text file in the current vim
buffer.

USAGE                                           *gf-ext-usage*

gf-ext works by allowing you to define a handler for files matching a certain
pattern.  If no pattern matches, it falls back to the default `gf` command.

To use the plugin, extract it to your vim plugins directory, and set up the
desired handlers using |gf_ext#add_handler|.  For example, to open .jpg files
with firefox, and .avi files with vlc, you could use: >
  call gf_ext#add_handler('\.jpg$', "!firefox -new-window")
  call gf_ext#add_handler('\.avi$', "!cvlc")
<

FUNCTIONS                                       *gf-ext-functions*

                                                *gf-ext-:gf_ext#add_handler*
:call gf_ext#add_handler {filepattern, handler}
                        Add a handler for files matching the pattern
                        filepattern.  This should be a regular expression in
                        a format recognised by vim's |match()| function.  The
                        handler is an ex mode command which will simply be
                        prepended to the filename.
